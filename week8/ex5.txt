What's the difference between physical and virtual memory?

Answer:

I would say that the virtual memory is something like a wrapper for the main physical memory.
Because it is larger than main memory and makes special mapping from some virtual, abstract addresses to the real ones.
As virtual memory is much bigger than main, when it stores the heavy processes it often swappes some memory to the hard disk and back.
