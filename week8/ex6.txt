16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How many entryes in single-level linear page table?

Solution:

As pages are 8 KB each, then 8192 = 2^(13), so 13 lower bits of the virtual address is used to specify the address within
the page (0-8191) - Offset. Other highest bits will used for indexing the pages:

16-13 = 3 bits => 2^(3) = 8 entries.

Answer 8 entries.
