STDOUT is line buffered.

So in 1 case:
	Printf command buffers the string "Hello", but do not outputs it;
	After fork we will have 2 processes with 2 buffered "Hello" string
	Then printf('\n') just outputs buffer for every process that's why output is
	Hello
	Hello

In 2 case:
	Printf command will print word "Hello" BEFORE fork, as it end with line separator.
	That's why after fork we will have 2 process which will only create empty line and output will be:
	Hello
